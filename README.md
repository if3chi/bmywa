## About BMYWA
<p align="justify">Blooming Minds Young Writers Awards is one of many projects run by the Blooming Minds Change Champion Network (BMCCN) founded in 2016. The initiative is aimed at raising young African leaders by recognizing and rewarding children with creative abilities in writing and arts. The awards are held in Ghana and Nigeria. Winners are awarded cash prizes and a possible publishing deal. Children whose stories were shortlisted but did not win, will get the opportunity to attend a creative writing workshop to hone their writing skills.</p>
