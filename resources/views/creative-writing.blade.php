                <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">Creative writing simply means imaginative writing. It is
                    an expression of one’s thoughts inspired either by an actual or imaginative event. The Blooming
                    Minds Young writers Awards are aimed at getting young people to think creatively. The sole purpose
                    of these writing competitions are not to get children to ultimately become authors/ or writers but
                    inspire them to use the power of their imagination.</p>
                <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">Creativity in children is a skill that builds a
                    basis for a lifetime of clear communication, self-expression and analytical thinking which will
                    shape a huge part of every child’s future, as they would need to be creative to standout at whatever
                    career they find themselves. The aim is to get children to pay more attention to what happens around
                    them and as such paint or recreate a bigger picture from one single event. </p>
                <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8 prose prose-yellow prose-lg">Creative writing could be
                    <strong>poetry, short story,
                        fiction, and non-fiction</strong>. The theme for the <a href="{{ route('apply') }}">Blooming
                        Minds Young Writers Awards</a> is
                    AFRICAN.
                    The stories must depict the African culture. This means that entrants are required to write stories
                    that reflect the
                    day to day life of a child/individual/or group of people who are African and lives in Africa. It is
                    not restricted to an African village but also capturing city life in Africa.
